# JMR-800

**JMR-800** is a modern, open-source clone of the Roland PG-800 hardware programmer, built around the Teensy 4.1 microcontroller. It provides real-time 
parameter control for vintage Roland synthesizers such as the JX-8P, MKS-70, and JX-10 using the original PG-800 communication protocol.

The JMR-800 replicates the original PG-800's functionality and physical interface, enabling direct, tactile editing of synthesizer parameters through a 
hands-on control surface.

## Features

- Compatible with Roland synths that support the PG-800 interface
- Built on Teensy 4.1 with fast, low-latency signal handling
- Accurate emulation of the PG-800 protocol (Clock, Ready, and Data lines)
- Designed for easy assembly and expansion
- Open hardware and firmware

## Status

This project is currently in active development. Basic communication and parameter changes are being validated. Contributions, forks, and collaboration are 
welcome.
